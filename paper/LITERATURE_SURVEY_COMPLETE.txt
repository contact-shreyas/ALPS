SECTION 2: LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1 Introduction

The proliferation of Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) represents a rapidly 
intensifying environmental disturbance with documented impacts spanning 
ecological systems, human health, astronomical observations, and energy 
sustainability [1]. While the quantification and mitigation of light pollution 
has historically relied on ground-based photometry and static policy frameworks, 
recent advances in satellite remote sensing, spatiotemporal machine learning, 
model explainability techniques, and autonomous decision systems have enabled 
unprecedented capabilities for real-time monitoring and adaptive intervention. 
This literature survey synthesizes five interconnected research strands that 
collectively inform the Agentic Light Pollution Sentinel (ALPS) framework: 
(a) satellite-based nighttime light measurement and calibration, 
(b) ecological and societal impacts of artificial light pollution, 
(c) spatiotemporal machine learning methods for environmental prediction, 
(d) interpretable AI for policy-relevant decision support, and 
(e) autonomous systems for environmental monitoring and adaptive control.

2.2 Satellite Remote Sensing of Nighttime Lights

2.2.1 Evolution from DMSP-OLS to VIIRS Black Marble

The systematic measurement of anthropogenic light emissions from space began 
with the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System 
(DMSP-OLS), which provided global nighttime radiance data from 1992 to 2013 
[2,3]. Cinzano et al. [2] pioneered computational methods to map artificial 
sky brightness from DMSP-OLS measurements, establishing the foundation for 
global light pollution atlases. Falchi et al. [4] extended this work to create 
the seminal World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness, revealing that over 
80% of humanity experiences light-polluted skies. However, DMSP-OLS suffered 
from coarse spatial resolution (~2.7 km), lack of on-board calibration, and 
saturation in bright urban cores [5].

The launch of NASA's Suomi NPP satellite in 2011, carrying the Visible Infrared 
Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS-DNB), marked a paradigm shift in 
nighttime light remote sensing [6]. VIIRS offers superior spatial resolution 
(~500 m at nadir), radiometric calibration, and dynamic range, enabling 
detection of radiance variations from 3×10⁻⁹ to 2×10⁻⁴ W·cm⁻²·sr⁻¹ [7]. The 
NASA Black Marble product suite (VNP46A1 daily, VNP46A2 8-day composite, 
VNP46A3 monthly composite) incorporates atmospheric correction, cloud masking, 
stray light removal, and lunar BRDF normalization [8]. Bará et al. [9] 
demonstrated quantitative evaluation of outdoor artificial light emissions using 
low Earth orbit radiometers, establishing VIIRS as the gold standard for 
anthropogenic light monitoring. Recent methodological advances include 
ML-enhanced atmospheric correction algorithms [10], spectral disaggregation 
techniques using ISS imagery [11], and harmonized DMSP-VIIRS time series for 
long-term trend analysis [12].

2.2.2 Applications in Urban and Environmental Monitoring

VIIRS nighttime lights have been extensively applied to proxy socioeconomic 
indicators including GDP, population density, electrification rates, and energy 
consumption [13,14,15]. Agnihotri and Mishra [16] demonstrated strong 
correlations between Indian economic growth and VIIRS radiance (R² = 0.87), 
validating the use of nighttime lights as real-time economic indicators. For 
environmental applications, Chen et al. [17] integrated VIIRS data with Landsat 
imagery for long-term landslide monitoring in urbanized Taiwan, while 
Bustamante-Calabria et al. [18] analyzed COVID-19 lockdown impacts on urban 
light emissions using combined ground photometry and VIIRS measurements. Gafoor 
et al. [19] explored relationships between NPP-VIIRS nighttime lights and carbon 
footprints in the UAE, establishing quantitative links between luminous 
intensity and greenhouse gas emissions.

Critical challenges remain in VIIRS data utilization. Barentine [20] 
demonstrated that VIIRS-DNB radiance products are insufficient for assessing 
reflected light from high-albedo pavements without ground-truth validation, 
while Bará and Castro-Torres [21] identified diverging evolution patterns 
between citizen science observations (Globe at Night) and VIIRS-DNB 
measurements, highlighting the need for multi-modal validation. Recent 
innovations address these limitations through generative AI for nighttime image 
reconstruction [22], panchromatic-to-color transformation using machine learning 
[23], and deep learning approaches for translating multispectral imagery to 
nighttime radiance [24].

2.3 Ecological and Policy Dimensions of Artificial Light at Night

2.3.1 Biological and Health Impacts

Artificial light at night constitutes a pervasive environmental stressor with 
cascading effects across biological scales. Falchi and Bará [25] characterized 
ALAN as a global disruptor of night-time ecosystems, documenting impacts on 
circadian rhythms, predator-prey dynamics, pollination networks, and migratory 
navigation. Choudhary and Kumar [26] provided a comprehensive review of light 
pollution severity, identifying multifaceted impacts ranging from melatonin 
suppression and sleep disruption in humans to behavioral alterations in 
nocturnal species. The astronomical community has raised urgent concerns 
regarding the dual threat of ground-based light pollution and satellite 
mega-constellations [27,28], with Kocifaj et al. [29] quantifying the 
contribution of space objects to artificial night sky brightness.

Jechow et al. [30,31] developed all-sky photometry techniques to investigate 
cloud amplification effects on skyglow, demonstrating that overcast conditions 
can increase artificial sky brightness by factors of 2-10 depending on cloud 
optical depth and urban proximity. This work established critical linkages 
between atmospheric physics and light pollution propagation. Bará et al. [32,33] 
extended these analyses to coastal and aquatic environments, revealing 
significant ALAN intrusion into marine ecosystems through aquaculture 
installations and offshore industrial lighting.

2.3.2 Policy Frameworks and Monitoring Challenges

Effective light pollution mitigation requires robust monitoring infrastructure 
and evidence-based policy mechanisms. Pun et al. [34] deployed the first 
comprehensive night sky brightness monitoring network in Hong Kong, revealing 
quantitative contributions from different artificial lighting sources and 
establishing baselines for regulatory enforcement. Angeloni et al. [35,36] 
conducted spectro-photometric characterization of Chilean night skies, providing 
reference measurements for astronomical observatories and informing national 
lighting policies.

The transition from traditional lighting technologies to LEDs has introduced new 
complexities. Sánchez de Miguel et al. [37] demonstrated that Sky Quality Meter 
(SQM) measurements exhibit spectral biases in response to LED color temperature 
changes, necessitating wavelength-specific calibration for temporal trend 
analysis. Bará et al. [38,39] developed monitoring frameworks to detect changes 
in anthropogenic light emissions while accounting for atmospheric variability, 
establishing statistical detection limits for policy-relevant brightness 
thresholds. Falchi and Bará [40] proposed linear systems approaches for 
protecting astronomical observatory dark skies through systematic control of 
upward light flux ratios and spatial propagation models.

2.4 Spatiotemporal Machine Learning for Environmental Prediction

2.4.1 Gradient Boosting and Tree-Based Ensemble Methods

The application of gradient boosting machines (GBMs) to geospatial and 
environmental problems has demonstrated superior performance compared to 
traditional statistical models and deep neural networks in many contexts 
[41,42]. LightGBM and XGBoost, leveraging histogram-based split finding and 
parallel tree construction, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on tabular data 
with efficient training times [43]. In environmental applications, these methods 
excel at capturing non-linear relationships, interactions between climate/
land-use variables, and threshold effects without requiring extensive feature 
engineering [44].

Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of tree-based ensembles for air 
quality prediction (R² > 0.90 with meteorological and satellite features) [45], 
flood risk modeling [46], and ecological niche prediction [47]. The 
computational efficiency of LightGBM (often 10-20× faster than XGBoost for 
equivalent accuracy) is particularly valuable for operational systems requiring 
daily model updates [48]. Training times under 60 seconds for datasets with 
10⁵-10⁶ observations enable real-time adaptation to policy interventions and 
environmental changes [49].

2.4.2 Deep Learning Approaches and Comparative Performance

Deep learning architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been applied to spatiotemporal 
environmental forecasting with mixed results [50,51]. While LSTMs excel at 
capturing long-range temporal dependencies in sequential data (e.g., time series 
of satellite imagery), they often require orders of magnitude more training data 
and computational resources than GBMs to achieve comparable accuracy [52]. For 
tabular geospatial data with < 10⁶ training examples, tree-based methods 
typically outperform deep learning models in both accuracy and inference speed 
[53].

Hybrid approaches combining CNNs for spatial feature extraction with GBMs for 
prediction have shown promise in land cover classification and urban growth 
modeling [54]. However, the interpretability-performance trade-off remains a 
critical consideration for policy applications, where model transparency is 
often as important as predictive accuracy [55].

2.5 Explainable AI for Policy-Relevant Decision Support

2.5.1 SHAP Values and Feature Attribution Methods

SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have emerged as the theoretically grounded 
framework for model-agnostic feature attribution [56,57]. Derived from 
cooperative game theory, SHAP values quantify each feature's marginal 
contribution to predictions while satisfying desirable properties including 
local accuracy, missingness, and consistency [58]. TreeSHAP, the optimized 
algorithm for tree-based models, computes exact Shapley values in polynomial 
time by exploiting tree structure [59], enabling efficient interpretation of 
ensemble methods without approximation errors.

Recent applications of SHAP to environmental and geospatial problems include: 
thermospheric neutral density prediction with identification of solar irradiance 
as the dominant driver [60], land-use change modeling revealing non-linear 
urbanization thresholds [61], and air quality forecasting with temporal 
evolution of feature importance across seasons [62]. Causal SHAP extensions 
incorporate causal discovery to distinguish direct vs. mediated feature effects, 
addressing a key limitation of correlation-based attribution methods [63].

2.5.2 Interpretability for Policy Transparency

Explainable AI is particularly critical in policy-relevant applications where 
stakeholder trust, regulatory compliance, and evidence-based intervention design 
require transparent decision logic [64,65]. Vassiliades et al. [66] demonstrated 
integration of large language models with XAI frameworks to generate natural 
language explanations of SHAP attributions, enhancing accessibility for 
non-technical policymakers. In environmental justice contexts, SHAP analyses 
have revealed disparities in pollution exposure across demographic groups, 
informing targeted interventions [67].

The stability and consistency of explanations under perturbations remains an 
active research challenge. Ballegeer et al. [68] evaluated SHAP stability in 
cost-sensitive credit scoring, finding that local attributions can vary 
significantly for similar instances in high-dimensional feature spaces. This 
motivates aggregation strategies such as SHAP summary plots and clustered 
feature importance rankings to provide robust global interpretations [69,70].

2.6 Autonomous Systems for Environmental Monitoring

2.6.1 Sense-Reason-Act-Learn Frameworks

Autonomous control systems for environmental applications have traditionally 
followed reactive or model-predictive architectures [71]. Recent advances in 
reinforcement learning and model-free optimization have enabled more 
sophisticated Sense-Reason-Act-Learn (SRAL) loops that adapt decision policies 
based on observed outcomes [72,73]. Key characteristics of effective SRAL 
systems include: (a) real-time data ingestion from multi-modal sensors, 
(b) probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty, (c) automated actuation with 
human-in-the-loop overrides, and (d) continuous learning from feedback signals 
[74].

Applications span precision agriculture (adaptive irrigation control) [75], 
wildlife monitoring (autonomous camera trap networks) [76], and air quality 
management (dynamic traffic regulation) [77]. Trivedi et al. [78] surveyed 
intelligent sensing-to-action frameworks for robust autonomy at the edge, 
highlighting challenges in latency-constrained decision-making, energy-efficient 
inference, and resilience to sensor failures.

2.6.2 Adaptive Decision Support in Environmental Systems

Structural health monitoring of infrastructure provides analogous use cases for 
autonomous environmental decision systems. Arul and Kareem [79] developed 
anomaly detection methods using shapelet transforms on sensor time series, 
enabling early warning of structural deterioration. Multi-temporal analysis 
scales (hourly sensing, daily reasoning, monthly learning) balance 
responsiveness with statistical robustness [80].

Critical research gaps include formal verification of autonomous environmental 
systems (ensuring safety constraints are satisfied) [81], human-AI collaboration 
patterns for contested policy decisions [82], and scalability to heterogeneous 
sensor networks with varying data quality [83]. The integration of causal 
inference methodologies with adaptive control remains an open challenge, 
particularly for distinguishing intervention effects from confounding 
environmental factors [84].

2.7 Research Gaps and ALPS Contributions

Despite extensive progress across these five research domains, significant gaps 
persist at their intersection:

1. TEMPORAL RESOLUTION MISMATCH: While VIIRS provides daily radiance 
   measurements, most light pollution studies report annual or seasonal 
   aggregates [2,4,21], limiting the ability to detect short-term policy impacts 
   or anomalous events.

2. SPATIAL GRANULARITY FOR POLICY: Global and national-scale analyses dominate 
   the literature [4,25,40], yet municipal lighting regulations require district 
   or neighborhood-level intelligence that exceeds VIIRS native resolution 
   (~500 m) [20,34].

3. DECOMPOSITION OF LIGHT SOURCES: Few studies systematically separate 
   anthropogenic vs. natural (moonlight, airglow, zodiacal light) contributions 
   or disaggregate fixed infrastructure vs. transient sources (traffic, events) 
   [9,33,38], complicating targeted interventions.

4. ML MODEL INTERPRETABILITY: Geospatial ML applications often prioritize 
   predictive accuracy over explainability [50,51,54], yet policy applications 
   demand transparent attribution of predictions to environmental, demographic, 
   and infrastructure variables [64,65,67].

5. CLOSED-LOOP ADAPTATION: Existing monitoring systems (e.g., Hong Kong network 
   [34], Chilean observatories [36]) operate in open-loop mode without automated 
   feedback mechanisms to adjust alert thresholds or recommend policy actions 
   based on measured outcomes [71-74].

6. CROSS-REGION GENERALIZATION: Training datasets are typically localized to 
   specific geographic contexts (e.g., European cities [40], Chilean 
   observatories [35]), limiting model transferability to regions with different 
   lighting practices, climatic conditions, or regulatory frameworks [47,53].

The Agentic Light Pollution Sentinel (ALPS) framework addresses these gaps 
through:

• DAILY DISTRICT-LEVEL MONITORING: Aggregation of VIIRS VNP46A1 daily products 
  to 742 Indian district boundaries, enabling sub-500m effective resolution 
  through geometric overlay with administrative polygons.

• AUTOMATED SOURCE DECOMPOSITION: Decomposition of observed radiance into 
  natural background (F_nat), fixed infrastructure (F_infra), and transient 
  anthropogenic (F_anthro) components using temporal pattern analysis and 
  SHAP-guided feature attribution.

• EXPLAINABLE LIGHTGBM PREDICTIONS: Integration of gradient boosting 
  (R² = 0.952, 56.7s training time) with TreeSHAP analysis to quantify feature 
  importance across policy phases (2016-2018 pre-LED, 2019-2022 transition, 
  2023-2025 AI-regulated).

• AUTONOMOUS SRAL POLICY LOOP: Hourly satellite data ingestion (SENSE), daily 
  ML-based anomaly detection with 18-36h predictive lead time (REASON), 
  real-time alert deployment to municipal authorities (ACT), and monthly model 
  retraining based on policy effectiveness metrics (LEARN).

• DEMONSTRATED GENERALIZATION: Cross-region validation yielding Migration 
  R² = 0.934 across districts with heterogeneous urbanization levels, population 
  densities, and baseline radiance values.

• OPEN-SOURCE REPRODUCIBILITY: Full codebase, pre-processed district-level time 
  series (2014-2025), and interactive dashboard deployed enabling replication 
  and extension to other geographic contexts.

This synthesis of satellite remote sensing, interpretable machine learning, and 
autonomous decision frameworks represents a novel contribution to the 
intersection of environmental informatics, computational sustainability, and 
evidence-based policy design.
