SECTION 2: LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1 Introduction

Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) represents a rapidly intensifying environmental 
disturbance with documented impacts on ecological systems, human health, 
astronomical observations, and energy sustainability [1]. This literature survey 
synthesizes five interconnected research strands: (a) satellite-based nighttime 
light measurement, (b) ecological and policy impacts of light pollution, 
(c) spatiotemporal machine learning methods, (d) interpretable AI for policy 
support, and (e) autonomous environmental monitoring systems.

2.2 Satellite Remote Sensing of Nighttime Lights

Early global nighttime radiance measurements began with DMSP-OLS (1992-2013) 
[2,3], enabling Cinzano et al. [2] and Falchi et al. [4] to create foundational 
light pollution atlases revealing that over 80% of humanity experiences 
light-polluted skies. However, DMSP-OLS suffered from coarse resolution (~2.7 
km) and sensor saturation [5]. The NASA VIIRS-DNB sensor aboard Suomi NPP (2011) 
marked a paradigm shift with superior spatial resolution (~500 m), radiometric 
calibration, and dynamic range [6,7]. The Black Marble product suite (VNP46A1 
daily, VNP46A2/A3 composites) incorporates atmospheric correction, cloud 
masking, and lunar BRDF normalization [8]. Recent advances include ML-enhanced 
atmospheric correction [10], ISS-based spectral disaggregation [11], and 
harmonized DMSP-VIIRS time series [12].

VIIRS data has been extensively applied to proxy socioeconomic indicators 
including GDP and energy consumption [13-15], with Agnihotri and Mishra [16] 
demonstrating R²=0.87 correlations for Indian economic growth. Environmental 
applications include landslide monitoring [17], COVID-19 lockdown impact 
analysis [18], and carbon footprint estimation [19]. Critical challenges remain 
in ground-truth validation [20] and reconciling satellite measurements with 
citizen science observations [21]. Recent innovations employ generative AI for 
nighttime image reconstruction [22] and deep learning for multispectral-to-
nighttime radiance translation [23,24].

2.3 Ecological and Policy Dimensions of ALAN

ALAN constitutes a pervasive environmental stressor affecting circadian rhythms, 
predator-prey dynamics, pollination networks, and migratory navigation [25,26]. 
The astronomical community has raised concerns about dual threats from ground-
based pollution and satellite mega-constellations [27,28], with Kocifaj et al. 
[29] quantifying space objects' contribution to sky brightness. Jechow et al. 
[30,31] demonstrated cloud amplification effects increasing artificial sky 
brightness by factors of 2-10, while Bará et al. [32,33] revealed significant 
ALAN intrusion into marine ecosystems.

Policy frameworks require robust monitoring infrastructure. Pun et al. [34] 
deployed Hong Kong's comprehensive night sky brightness network, while Angeloni 
et al. [35,36] characterized Chilean observatories for national lighting 
policies. The LED transition introduced spectral measurement complexities 
[37,38,39], necessitating wavelength-specific calibration. Falchi and Bará [40] 
proposed linear systems approaches for protecting astronomical dark skies 
through upward light flux control.

2.4 Spatiotemporal Machine Learning

Gradient boosting machines (GBMs) including LightGBM and XGBoost demonstrate 
superior performance on geospatial tabular data compared to deep learning models 
[41-43]. Tree-based ensembles excel at capturing non-linear relationships and 
threshold effects without extensive feature engineering [44], achieving R²>0.90 
for air quality prediction [45], flood risk modeling [46], and ecological niche 
prediction [47]. LightGBM's computational efficiency (10-20× faster than 
XGBoost) enables operational systems with daily model updates and training times 
under 60 seconds for 10⁵-10⁶ observations [48,49].

While deep learning architectures (LSTMs, CNNs) show promise for sequential data 
[50,51], they typically require orders of magnitude more training data than GBMs 
for comparable accuracy on tabular geospatial datasets [52,53]. Hybrid CNN-GBM 
approaches balance spatial feature extraction with prediction efficiency [54], 
though the interpretability-performance trade-off remains critical for policy 
applications [55].

2.5 Explainable AI for Policy Support

SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provide theoretically grounded feature 
attribution [56,57], quantifying each feature's marginal contribution while 
satisfying local accuracy, missingness, and consistency properties [58]. 
TreeSHAP computes exact Shapley values in polynomial time for tree-based models 
[59], enabling efficient interpretation without approximation errors. 
Environmental applications include thermospheric density prediction [60], land-
use change modeling [61], and air quality forecasting with temporal feature 
importance evolution [62]. Causal SHAP extensions distinguish direct vs. 
mediated effects [63].

Explainable AI is critical for policy applications requiring stakeholder trust 
and transparent decision logic [64,65]. Vassiliades et al. [66] integrated LLMs 
with XAI frameworks for natural language explanations, while environmental 
justice applications revealed pollution exposure disparities [67]. SHAP 
stability under perturbations remains challenging [68], motivating aggregation 
strategies like summary plots and clustered feature rankings [69,70].

2.6 Autonomous Environmental Monitoring

Autonomous Sense-Reason-Act-Learn (SRAL) systems adapt decision policies based 
on observed outcomes [71-73], incorporating real-time data ingestion, 
probabilistic reasoning, automated actuation with human-in-the-loop overrides, 
and continuous learning from feedback [74]. Applications span precision 
agriculture [75], wildlife monitoring [76], and air quality management [77]. 
Trivedi et al. [78] surveyed intelligent sensing-to-action frameworks, 
highlighting challenges in latency-constrained decision-making and sensor 
failure resilience.

Structural health monitoring provides analogous use cases, with Arul and Kareem 
[79] developing anomaly detection using shapelet transforms for early warning 
systems. Multi-temporal analysis scales (hourly sensing, daily reasoning, 
monthly learning) balance responsiveness with statistical robustness [80]. 
Critical gaps include formal verification of safety constraints [81], human-AI 
collaboration patterns [82], scalability to heterogeneous sensor networks [83], 
and causal inference integration [84].

2.7 Research Gaps and ALPS Contributions

Despite extensive progress, significant gaps persist: (1) TEMPORAL RESOLUTION 
MISMATCH - most studies report annual/seasonal aggregates despite daily VIIRS 
availability [2,4,21]; (2) SPATIAL GRANULARITY - national-scale analyses 
dominate despite municipal policy needs [4,25,40]; (3) SOURCE DECOMPOSITION - 
few studies systematically separate anthropogenic vs. natural or fixed vs. 
transient sources [9,33,38]; (4) ML INTERPRETABILITY - geospatial ML often 
prioritizes accuracy over explainability [50,51,54] versus policy transparency 
needs [64,65,67]; (5) CLOSED-LOOP ADAPTATION - existing monitoring systems 
operate open-loop without automated feedback [34,36,71-74]; (6) CROSS-REGION 
GENERALIZATION - localized training limits model transferability [35,40,47,53].

ALPS addresses these through: (a) Daily district-level monitoring aggregating 
VIIRS VNP46A1 to 742 Indian districts for sub-500m effective resolution; 
(b) Automated source decomposition into F_nat, F_infra, F_anthro components 
using temporal pattern analysis and SHAP attribution; (c) Explainable LightGBM 
predictions (R²=0.952, 56.7s training) with TreeSHAP analysis across policy 
phases; (d) Autonomous SRAL policy loop with hourly sensing, daily ML-based 
anomaly detection (18-36h predictive lead time), real-time alerts, and monthly 
model retraining; (e) Demonstrated generalization (Migration R²=0.934) across 
heterogeneous districts; (f) Open-source reproducibility with full codebase and 
pre-processed time series (2014-2025).

This synthesis of satellite remote sensing, interpretable machine learning, and 
autonomous decision frameworks represents a novel contribution to environmental 
informatics, computational sustainability, and evidence-based policy design.
